# NCRP_HLDA
In this project, a simple Nested Chinese Restaurant Process is implemented. this is done by using HLDA for topic modeling with Gibbs Sampler. this project demonstrates the BBC Insight Dataset for evaluation.

Here is tried to simulate the process explained in the “The Nested Chinese Restaurant Process and Bayesian Nonparametric Inference of Topic Hierarchies” paper written by DAVID M. BLEI, THOMAS L. GRIFFITHS and MICHAEL I. JORDAN.
